# Questions for Spring and Java Interview preparation

1. Significance of 'var' keyword in java 10+. And all the cases.
	1. Firstly,
	```
	var person = new Person();
	```
	> It serves the same purpose as:
	```
	Person person = new Person();
	```
	BUT, it is not same as the 'var' in javascript.
**Javascript is a dyamically typed language whereas Java is Statically typed language.**
In javascript a variable doesn't have information about the variable. It does not have restrictions on what it can contain. It is just a holder for a value, and the value can be of any type.
<br>
Java is a statically typed language and the opposite is true for all of those statements. A programmer has to say up-front what type their variable can hold.

2. JRE, JVM and JDK.

3. JIT and JVM difference.
